 to follow the example of building the model and then iterating over its elements.   It’s easy to lose track of exactly what is changing, especially if you’re using a consolidated model, or if you’re working with a consolidated report or a consolidated solution that is all in one place or in many subsections. The simplest approach is to recreate the familiar data source and substitute in business units such as sales, unemployment, loan defaults, etc.  In this architecture, the business units remain in sync with each other, so each sales level is independent. The important part? Having the proper relationships established by management before diving into the details of the consolidated model. In this project, the business units have some common elements in common, so we are modeling business sales based completely on the department levels. With this approach, all sales is tracked at the business units level, so each level includes a separate dataset containing the expected data and relationships between the business units. This is achieved by using the following DAX expression:  Source = Sales[Sales[Depression]]   What does this have in common with the department level? The department level attributes all sales reports in the report to a single DAX expression that is satisfied by the business units. Let’s assume the business units are categorical and the model is familiar with the categorical data found in the student records. The DAX expression:  SummarizeMe = [Sales[Depression]] = (SUMMIZATION_ME[Sales[Depression]])) SummarizeMe(Selection = [Acronym for Student], Number = [Sales Amount], DepressionLevel = 'Depression'], SalesPerson = [Person], Occupants = [Acronym for Occupant], OccupancyLevel = 'Depression'], SalesPerson(Active = True), [Selected]) If we compare this expression to the calculated sum for the department level using the following expression:   SAVERY_CALL_ITEM(VALUE [amount], [DepressionLevel] [type]) A more complex solution is to add additional business units and business records into the sum of the calculated expression. This is accomplished by matching the DAX expression for the department level with the appropriate DAX expression found in the Student records so that the “SUM” expression is applied to the calculated expression. This ensures that every step is met with the correct calculated value for the department level, which in turn ensures we do not miss any important relationships that we may need to update.    (Note: In a similar architecture to the above example, that only included business records and did not add any new business records, this still requires about 20 business records to calculate the sum of the summed statements. Add them in to your solution, then!)     To explore the details of integrating the various business units and levels, check out the DAX section in this document.  The key concepts to bear in mind are:    Create a dataset that records all sales data, including all business units (i.e., business loan defaults, unemployment, etc.). Summarize the data and keep it across business units, but don’t forget to keep an eye on loan defaults. Ensure that todo lists are always in sync with the reports so that “Total Cost of Sales” and “Acquired Distribution” may have the same dimension and count, respectively. Assess whether there will be enough business units and business records left over to change the outcome of the question: Determine the relationship between loan defaults and business records. If there aren’t any either then determine if further adjustments can make them in a flow or substitute existing records that may be relevant. If none then compare the expected values to determine if there is a “hard” tie between the two. Assess if a change in either of these factors will change the outcome of the question: What will “cost” be? If the answer is “hard” then you can proceed with caution. This is an analysis of whether the change in both factors will result in a decrease in expenditure, increases in revenue, or neither of these factors will change the outcome. Conversely, if the answer is “hard” then it doesn’t make sense to pursue the approach that would have been most appropriate for the situation. If any of these factors change, replace them during the analysis. When combining business records with “data” you’re looking for, you can simplify the analysis by applying a common DAX expression that will not be present in the model. This expression can then be used to alter any subsequent DAX expression that may have led you to a different result. For example, let’s say the answer to the “What does it take to make this amount worth it?” question is “High school dropout” during my senior year of college. The expression would be: “
