======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 sample is also available with PolyBase and other libraries via Microsoft’s SDK.  PolyBase is a collection of packages that provide interfaces for defining data types, data frames, or stage relationships, as well as the creation and operation of data lakes and workspaces. From a performance perspective, PolyBase is just one of the many tools Microsoft uses to help deploy modern BI deployments. PolyBase also provides functionality to provide security and audit-proof scenarios to clients. For example, an organization might include security in its security communication channels so that users of a managed organization-wide Office 365 Pro authorization key can access them from any IP address. Security has the following pros/cons for Office 365: Allows for easy access if using corporate network folders. Difficult to use sensitive security in Outlook files. Allows quick access to resources (DataFrames, Workspaces, Security Groups, etc.). Provides some technique to maintain audit trails for O365 admins who wish to leverage procured data Source control of AMLS applications. Proven organization-level security for Workspaces and WorkspacesPerInApp and WorkspacesPerInDemand Perkin Torvalds Office 365 Admin Pro Closes this series – Given the above description, we might consider considering other security solutions in a future post.   Security around Office 365 grew out of an awareness among software security administrators and our ability to provide support and professional assistance to our Office 365 customers. With that kind of support and support, we are continuously able to extend the life of our solutions and modernize the quality of security and data warehousing solutions in our clients' networks. On April 1, BlueGranite received the first-ever Office 365 Admin Pro security blog post. This piece provided a brief overview of the functionality and selected services that were used to create the blog post. The piece generated a great deal of excitement across the Office 365 community, including Twitter and Facebook followups and even some thoughtful Facebook Live checks and quick refresh of portfolio assets. The excitement began to take a turn when one Twitter follower landed a prize for his/her efforts. As the name might suggest, some very nice users on the @Office365_PowerUser_Report page had already been named with the company’s hosting provider. As of this writing, there are four more names to go along with the remaining individuals not named. At this point, we’d like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of those named who got this post going and the community at large. Though this does not prove nor disprove any particular organization or individuals are the primary cause of any Office 365 concern, nor does it imply that all security issues are currentlyogenic. In any case, here are the top three specific scenarios we were told:</story><script async    src= \"https://www.blue-granite.com/blogs/the-top-three-tips-for-having-power-considered\" = https://www.blue-granite.com/blog/topic/tips-for-having-power-considered/  For more technical details on what this project needed, check out our previous post on DataSavvy & Power BI Premium.If you would like to download and use the code for this project, please visit our GitHub site at https://github.com/blue-granite/powerbitbi/blob/master/README?LI~?SOURCE=TRUE&DEV=OTO&CODE=v2 After applying the techniques presented here, you can expect a very quick-moving report that makes fast and valuable changes quickly. When running a data analytics project, there is very rarely a point where an individual should rush to code-test his or her data. Instead, organizations should strive to incorporate leading-edge tools into the design of the solution. In this post, we will look at two approaches to fixing a failing Power BI report.Before we proceed, read the documentation included in the implementation plan. Additionally, be sure to subscribe to BlueGranite’s YouTube series where we will provide a series of informative videos on every video, including a live stream, every month. We are also excited to help both beginning and advanced users of Power BI have a successful experience with the tool!"
