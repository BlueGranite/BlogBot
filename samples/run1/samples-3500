"186" "In the early days of Power BI, the Power BI Service was a collection of Power BI products integrated into a single application. It required less configuration than competing free functionality, and customers could purchase and share data on many Power BI reports at much lower cost. As consumers increasingly use Power BI with their business, many factors have developed that make an integration and utility integration of Power BI Services with applications more efficient and secure than competing free and paid capabilities.   As the pioneer of Power BI integration technologies, BlueGranite partnered with Microsoft to create the Power BI Enterprise Service. The Power BI service integrates with Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Power BI Desktop and Power BI App to offer business users more control and control over the service’s functionality. Business users can even create reports and view results from the service itself, as long as these are governed by Power BI’s permissions. This type of management can be automated and scaled up or down based on business needs. This type of integration means that Power BI users can create reports that are compatible with business requirements, and that include business use, organization cost, and features and limitations of other tools. BlueGranite expects this type of self-service integration to grow in popularity with consumers of Power BI. The Power BI Service also allows Microsoft to maintain greater control over program and content quality even when only parts of reports are used. The service also allows users to share data and perform other services in Power BI on an individual basis, rather than creating a multi-tenant service. This reduces the temptation for clients to create Power BI reports and content, and will minimize the costs associated with upgrading to Power BI Premium, as well as increasing the price of Power BI access for existing customers. Additionally, as the service has grown in popularity among business users, Microsoft has continued to grow its adoption of the platform. This trend is likely continuing with 2018. The 2018 Power BI Mobile Preview features some exciting features and features that add to Power BI’s historic capabilities. This preview feature, called “Build Power BI on your Mobile Device”, provides a much-needed mechanism for Microsoft to move the goal of delivering Power BI to mobile devices, rather than having them consume it. This feature provides much-needed, unified reporting and visualization capabilities (DMUs) that customers can use as a separate report or content entity rather than consuming separate reports and content as separate devices. This is especially true if you are developing Power BI content on mobile devices, such as tablets or laptops. The data model and report layout in this preview feature are still evolving. This means that additional controls and dimensions may require redesigns. Additionally, you have a limited amount of report content per report or content and functionality per user. This also means that there will be restrictions on how many reports and content can be published to different display types. Instead of trying to restrict Power BI to a subset of mobile devices, BlueGranite and other Power BI customers should be looking for a business value-based approach to consider where Power BI business value is being created. You can expect larger, more organized reports and content that are a great fit for this Power BI offering. You also can expect reports that support a smaller audience (less than report sizes) and more frequently report changes that are more than 1 week old (weekly refreshes). In addition, while Power BI is a service, you can choose to be part of a Microsoft-led Power Platform initiative to develop Power BI-like content that can connect with your organization’s data, analytics, and AI needs. Additionally, you can expect the free Power BI Service to allow you to choose the cost of services associated with the BI service, or pay for development and deployment. The free Power BI Service gives you access to other tools, such as PowerBI.com and the Power BI Business App, for creating Power BI reports and content with limited resources. This is very cool and will allow you to take advantage of the limited resources that remain for your business. Power BI was first developed by Microsoft as a free, easy-to-use service. Microsoft also developed Power BI Desktop, a unified workspace service that provides a convenient workspace for Power BI content creators to publish, share, and explore their data. Power BI service is now available in over 100 countries across the
