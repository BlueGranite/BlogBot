======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Hopefully, Azure Databricks is an easy way to deploy and interact with the data lake, leveraging a simple PowerShell script. As you navigate through the steps below, it is your job to ensure you use the correct repositories when creating your datasets. Once you have the scripts completed, head over to Azure Databricks and sign in for this solution's solution. Try it Out! After downloading and creating your needed packages, you are now ready to deploy whatever you are working with. As open source as PowerShell is, many of Azure Databricks' functionality is proprietary. As such, the following sample application uses some of Azure Databricks’s features and libraries to automate batch processing for instance. For more information, see \"Automating data ingestion and search through inbound and outside user interactions, using PowerShell and .NET libraries to simplify data entry and search among data publishers.

Bringing to life the Microsoft Flow–type of architecture You can probably use Databricks for batch processing in the cloud, but this architecture is only suitable for very large data sets where code execution is very specific to your workload. If you’re considering an architecture different from the above suggestions, consider using Azure Synapse Analytics for self-service data processing. Azure Synapse Analytics is a new Azure Cognitive Analytics platform that adds new capabilities to support traditional ETL and machine learning systems. Unlike code that may have certain structures such as Broca, Kerberos, and more recently, Hive, create a spark table in Azure Cognitive Analytics, Azure Synapse Analytics makes this platform easy to use and setup for your AI workloads. Spark may be a good language to learn Azure Synapse Analytics, it is open source and already has some examples written (see details below). In addition to writing a set of Spark code examples, the Azure team also plans to publish code that converts Spark queries to JSON Parquet. Our use of these APIs will be open to all Azure-based use cases. Don’t forget, these APIs are custom built and released as a open-source project for your company. See the docs for more information about this feature. Now that we’ve made our initial assessment, let’s examine the larger picture. Can Databricks Boost BI Performance in your Data Lake? Databricks, like many other open-source open-source platforms, includes features which can improve the performance of data Lake workloads. In this case, we’re not talking performance in the low thousands or even in the tens of thousands. In fact, the performance could be approaching 80 times what productive performance would be expected. Comparing the performance of two streams is just one of the ways in which Databricks can maximize benefit from the data in a data lake. Dynamic-Coding your Data is as easy as using a layer 1 framework like Databricks! Dynamic-Coding is really just a process for writing SQL queries to have the right delimited data be written in a format other languages can understand. This is a feature which Databricks has long implemented myself and others have worked with in Azure, Spartan, Spark, and Azure. In my experience, it is common for existing data engineers to leave the platform and instead use a different approach to handling data lake issues. It’s not uncommon to create a new ETL project just to have the delimited data beamed back to the source data file. It’s also common to create ETL projects in Azure with identical steps yet different tools for dealing with the different languages. One common reason for the incompatibility is because the ETL project written in both platforms only has
