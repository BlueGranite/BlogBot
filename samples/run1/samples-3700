 receiving a Power BI report’s URL. Power BI Report Server: The Power BI Report Server enables users to import data from Power BI, PowerApps, SQL Server Reporting Services, or other sources into a Power BI Report Server for sharing with other Power BI applications. The new features provide a new capability for the Power BI Report Server to send report URLs directly to any source server. For instance, the URL for an Excel report imported as a Power BI Report Server is: import_report('content/xlsx.xlsx', '/reports/xlsx') Importing directly from a Power BI report server can be complicated. Here’s a sample process to create a Reporting Service (Power BI Report Server) with its own report URL:  #example.com/ReportCreate.xlsx   Note: You should use Product Name or Product ID (e.g. BlueGranite’s Report Services) in the process of creating the PubSub, Subscriber, and Group memberships.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Use a single URL from source for all visualizations  One of the most useful features of Power BI is its ability to link to data from other software (such as Power Query or Excel). It is possible to create a simple Power BI visual with multiple URLs.   This may not be a good practice to share content outside your organization, especially if you want to import data directly from Power BI. Luckily, Microsoft provides a new built-in visual language called “Export.Export.” (available from the Power BI Documentation).   This tool makes exporting visuals easy. In this command, you can select the item in your visual language (e.g. “Embed.Embed.ProductName”).   Note: You may also want to highlight the selected item in your visual language (e.g. “Subscription.SubscriptionId”) so that it appears in the output of Export.Export. message. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3,5 “Send Data To A Data Lake ” This option allows you to send data to a data lake in Power BI Desktop. The first time you connect to the Power BI data portal, you will receive this message:  Not all Power BI data will be available at the Power BI Data Lake, so you should configure your source data folder per source Power BI application to avoid a situation like below:    If you don't specify a destination folder, the data in that folder is not available.   This setting should only be used for “Creating a Data Lake” purposes.   For other purposes, you may want to configure your destination data folder appropriately. The destination folder should be named whatever your Power BI data source is, like .xlsx in Excel.    Other references within your Power BI file should be named like this:     s3_vars = \"[vc_name]\"   = \"vc_name\".   The data in the data lake folder should include the following structure:   [s3_column = \"Source\")   [s3_column_2 = \"Source\")   [vc_name = \"ViewModel\"  ]   Finally, the data in the data lake folder should be named    null_tables OR  null_tsv (this is only one example).  When the Power BI Desktop process receives a message like the above, it should open a new file named “createDataLakeFolder” in the destination folder.  NOTE: You can still open the existing file in Power BI Desktop by using the “Open File” command available in the Power BI Service.  The contents of the file will not be saved in the destination folder, so these instructions only show how to open the file in Power BI Desktop.  3. Use a Power Query Editor  The Power Query Editor (Power Query Synapse or PQE) is an option that allows you to save a single Power BI visual between two or more applications.  The default Power Query Editor supports one version of Excel (v1) as a link and one version of Power Query (v2). (Please see the Power Query Editor documentation for more details on this option.) NOTE: Power Query does not have an option for exporting visuals using Power Query Editor. Instead, you must use Power Query Embedded to send a single link to a different Excel (v1) file, which can be found under the “Internet” section of the Power Query Online documentation site.   These instructions only cover the use of the Power Query Editor and not the Power Query Embedded option.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.
