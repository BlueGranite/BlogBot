======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 do for a project that is “working”. A simple example: we’ll create a dashboard that combines some of our data and upload it to our Azure Storage account. Users that recently enabled Validation should see a graph similar to the example provided. What it Does In Closing Navigate from this dashboard, you can either navigate to the root (blue line up next to your line graph) or you can create your own dashboards. Create a Power BI report There are many ways to share an dataset with users. You can share with a local sharing application such as SharePoint alone or with a user group (like SharePoint) that facilitates sharing. You can also share with multiple external applications or external websites that share files on your hard-drive or network. Some of the popular sites you can share on are:  Many of the popular sharing sites accept credit cards, which can be used to book your flight. You can also add email to your bookmarked dashboard, so it’s easy to send emails from the dashboard. Get Started... with a SharePoint Account   How do I start to use SharePoint? The steps below will help you get started and to develop a SharePoint account with your organization.   Step 1 Create a SharePoint SharePoint account is very important if you are creating reports and dashboard layouts, or creating mobile dashboards. Create a SharePoint dashboard that contains your Dashboard and other content that you have created. Send a link to your dashboard to a SharePoint dashboard you want to develop at https://mysharepointdashboard.com/create. Step 2 You will need to publish a dashboard or mobile app that will create a SharePoint dashboard. You can do that through Microsoft App Services or through SharePoint.com. Create a SharePoint report <iframe src='https://mysharepointdashboard.com/create/metadata/shared_report' disabledwidth='int' height='300' scrolling='no' alt='Content' width='500' height='250' border='0'/><iframe width='500' height='250' class='collapse' frames='both' framenumber='5' name='top'/><iframe width='450' height='250' class='collapse' frames=\"both\"></iframe>' id='myreport' scrolling='no' alt='Top Report'     Step 3 Create a new Shared Report (you can change the default value here). Include your dashboard content in the Top Report list by clicking the Document icon in the top right corner of your dashboard. Click “Create new report” when prompted.    Step 4 Submit the report to a accessible form. This step is similar to the previous step, but you can use a REST API call to create a REST API end-to-end Request Saver. Use the “Send a POST request” response from the report to create a POST request with additional data about your flight risk scenario and key values. Note that this data will stay in your Access_Token table behind your new Key_Value_Encoding table. For more information on how to create a POST API request with these steps, check out this blog post.  Step 5 Use a REST API to send a response back to your DAX processing table. This is different than the standard REST API requests that you have to commit to a database connection, so it’s not a terrible idea to use it just for that single request. In addition, since our request took a while, we’re using a precious memory (RAM) resource. The answer here is tolerance. Let’s look at two more powerful POST methods we'll touch on in this post. The Extract_Table and Extract_Table_Tables API calls deal with extracting the primary SUM of a table. The Extract_Table method pushes that result to the table like this:     table = DIVIDE(SELECT [Sales], [Key], [Employee_Date]], [Sales_Key], [Sales_Price]);    Using Extract_Table_Tables API call: table = DIVIDE(SELECT [Sales], [Key], [Employee_Date]], [Sales_Key], [Sales_Price]);    Using Extract_Table_Tables_Advanced call: table = DIVIDE(SELECT [Sales], [Key], [Sales_Key_Extended_Query_Key], [Employee_Date]], [Sales_Key_Extended_Query_Key_Extended_Query_Key]);    Now, our extracted table would look like this:     column_by = CAST([Sales_Key], [Sales_Key_Extended_Query_Key], 'Sales'[Key_Value]);    The first question you’ve probably heard when you’re finished with your Analysis Services or Power BI integration: “What are the goals of this post and its contents?”are
