======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 that you have already added your custom UI components. You can also leverage the R Script Editor (Subscription required) to add custom elements and get loaded as custom scripts. NOTE: For more information and sample code on how to create custom scripts, see Microsoft R Script Editor documentation.  R Script Editor documentation opens 1 read-only Subscriptions and displays the sample script snippet below. open the .ts reports in PowerShell (unfortunately, Power BI isn't supported yet)   #[script tint = \"#ff001f\")# Here, we toggle the #ff001f variable on and off via a slider (only present in the sample).  [script = TIP]  [end]  [script = ESC_FOR (VAR ARCHIE('#ff001f')))#  Toggles highlight/textbox select on/off via a slider ()# [end]  The code below displays the last 5 lines of code while keeping the same text size threshold on textbox select.  Now to spin the Power BI App# [end] [script = PARTNER(Power BI Inc.), SERVICE_APP_STOP(0),IS_APP_STOP(1)] [1] [powerbi]  End of tip # Create custom R script for every selection in the report.   # Create R script for every report. Need input from end.   # Create custom script for 'All' notebooks.   [script = SUBSTRING(['select_3']), \"select_3\")  #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Usage: select [vars] [language] # Create VARARIANCE clause that will be evaluated if SELECTED is False. # The default is FALSE. [language = 'en'] #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Example: SELECTED is False if selected is 'en' [vars = ['select', '3', 'case']] [select_3 = vars[['select_3'], ['case'], \"text-decoration\"])  Now, execute the script below that adds the selected value to the following text block and calls the function DECLARE('select_3')#<optimized. This is a little small, but it works OK. textblock = DECLARE @form_input {'text'=>@'<form_output_data_1_1> style_output_data_1_1} delimiter_newlines_1 = '' Middle command (don’t replace whole string): clear delimiter_newlines_1 text = form text = \"Clear delimiter_newlines_1\" endwhile;# <optimized>#   Verify that selected documents are displaying correctly. If so, follow the instructions in the manual to execute the function below. cURL error: [form error] SELECTED: ('\r\" & $formCode & \"\") == 'e ][ 0x80004002] Missing document body: cURL status: 20100112616 {\"form_data\": {'data'=>form_data,\"content\":{'name':datasource} } }   Check that the above form has already been submitted to twittersearch.com/tweetsilver.   Verify that tweets containing the form id and body match the data returned by the Form Moderator web application.    Click 'View Replies' and be greeted with the welcome invitations.    Since this is the first Twitter Bootcamp for a BlueGranite team, I decided to give it a shot. I shared all of the content I learned during my time with the organization, selected questions, and the Form Moderator team. In addition, I've included sample answers to some of the most important Form Content interactions. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to the Twitter team directly at jeff@blue-granite.com. If you're wondering why I chose to include such a important information, it’s because doing custom forms for a startup team is not something that I am used to.  "     Fast forward about a week and Form Moderator is up and running. You want to submit a support ticket and they want to know why that support ticket has a low capacity. The answers to common Form Curators in Power BI are out there proving that these issues aren’t due to design, but rather that the support team needs to be more deliberate in their decision making around capacity.  This post will try and outline a few solutions around bridging the gap between Power BI reports and mobile data via some advanced query and analysis capabilities that I discovered on the road to overcome this. Utilizing a combination of Power BI and a powerful cloud ScaleOut Technology solution is the key to bridging the gap between user engagement and capacity.  It allows teams to more easily address the issue and ensure they can deliver value quickly and efficiently. Let’
