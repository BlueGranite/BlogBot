 structured (e.g., distributed) model of the human body. For instance, how can we compute if our visual system is capable of ingesting information and performing other operations? To get more information on the nature and extent to which your data is being used in a particular manner, I have created a brief video that highlights some of my favorite topics, all of which are covered in further detail within the video. This piece will not address each of the concepts discussed in each particular, but rather will focus on the underlying concepts. What is Digital? Digital data can be read, written, stored, and analyzed by many different types of sources. Digital data may seem more sophisticated than traditional storage to many, but it stands out. A digital system is a collection of devices that connect to one another on a network, which can be replicated and changed. Modern computing devices use modern processors and storage technology to drive data across data systems and data processors in order to efficiently process information. However, that doesn't mean that digital storage is completely non-existent. As such, data and the internet can become more integrated and connected. While not a complete solution to the problems associated with our current state of technology, we can begin by having the source of the information and processing power, the physical devices, and the infrastructure behind the data accessible to the user and the user-generated data created on the device. This is done largely by having the data accessible on one's devices, rather than on a remote server. This is because, in fact, as we gain more technology, the information and data available to us may become more accessible and more easily transferred. And as that is done, one more step toward a more secure world. It is the potential power presented by data in the form of data that is now the source of all of our information. In this video, I will briefly outline the concepts, the most common use cases, and how this information can be stored in a variety of ways, from a variety of storage mediums. These topics are covered in more depth in the next few sections, however, as I explore more and more areas where I find myself using technology as a tool, or the result of an act of skill with what I am about to describe.  This article is a part-time project, so I am relying on your support in order to pay for the video.
