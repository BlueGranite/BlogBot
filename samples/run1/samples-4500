======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 at some stage.  Thus, the first step is to establish which parts of an architecture are most frequently used.  The data scientist in me is usually Bill Self, the Principal at BlueGranite.  I have read that self tends to be a very static job, which often forces me to rewrite complex models and measures all the time. This can cause my code to become more complicated or do I wake up every day and ask myself, 'How many times have I done this before? Why do I wake up every day and do this every time? ' Not nearly enough time to actually do this yet, so I try to write as much code I learn, as possible.  When I was Principal at BlueGranite, I wrote code to read and write the SSIS and R data files that I automatically added to Excel when I created the reports.  SSIS projects that the files are a one-time job which can be automated in the future with some human-like intervention by HR.  This is where we can use the custom SQL Server Analysis Services Piped file, or SCSI connection, to query the SSIS files simultaneously for analysis.  It also allows for data access across all the SSIS projects. If you are familiar with Excel's file system, you can probably use SQL Server Analysis Services Piped file as your main source.  Power BI has a built-in web portal, so you can also get access to your data sources directly in Power BI.  In addition to the information I needed to query the SSIS files, I needed to pin them down as rows of some data table.  Once I was happy with the query string, I used that to pin the data to a new row of data table.  I also added in the Power BI service account that I live in.  I added the SSIS files in this post and pinned them to a new row of data table.       "
"231" "I just saw Microsoft's first Desktop platformer, called  Office 365 . It's called “The Managed Folder” . It's like Office 365 in the sense that you keep all the folders in an organization’s \"managed folder\" (meaning all your folders are accessible by users). I think that’s really cool.” After downloading the app, I was immediately introduced to the SharePoint Desktop app and SharePoint Online apps.  The shareners have SharePoint Online, a shared folder concept that I personally like. Sharing is split into folders (studio, blog, etc.) and you share files between the two. The shareners app focuses more on sharing between users. The Desktop app is where I find Office 365, which I have been using a lot in the past (studio, blog, etc.)  The SharePoint app focuses more on supporting a single user rather than multiple applications. There are a lot of options, such as sharing folders with folders named "_", folders named "_", etc.  With the SharePoint app, I have two apps to handle all kinds of data: a data-driven data model, which I develop quickly, and a visualization, which I develop more as a data-driven user. The two SharePoint apps can be found under Apps. The SharePoint app makes usage of Excel spreadsheets in a single app. This is great for people who want to quickly see the numbers, as well as the model. The SharePoint app has two slicers that separate the data for reading, which I often think of as much more like Excel than Python. The slicers work together to sort the data, which is great when you need to wrangle it up in one app. Microsoft published a preview app with many more slicers and visualizations that I would love to see implemented. The SharePoint app has a single View, that can be opened in many apps or made fully accessible through a web browser. Each View has a slicer to sort data, which is great when you need to wrangle data in one workspace, or even expand it if an emergency arises. The SharePoint app also has a SharePoint gallery view that you can browse. The SharePoint app has three views to go around Office 365’s restrictions on web pages: a view with images (two of SharePoint app), a view with Power BI content (like maps), and a view with Microsoft Ink (two of SharePoint app)/PowerPunch (two of SharePoint app), and a view with Microsoft Mobile apps (two of SharePoint app). The SharePoint app also has a tool to share across tabs in a tabular app. The SharePoint app allows sharing to individual tabs using the same connection or tabs are searched together. Power BI content (like maps) runs in the background. The SharePoint app allows you to export data to SQL
