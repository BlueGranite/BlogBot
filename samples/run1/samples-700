======== SAMPLE 1 ========
y - Tensorflow Model Library (https://docs.dplyr.org/tools/datasets/learning/model-learning/tensor-clr/) in R and RStudio.

In addition to Model Training, the other two datasets are Python Scripts, and R packages and libraries.

The Scripts are a series of Python packages. R is your package manager. R packages are packages that define the R programming language and the R package itself. For this tutorial, I will be using RStudio, but I will be using SciPy, Flume, and the same package as shown below.  Note: I will leave the Flume package as an example because I will use SciPy instead of RStudio, but Flume, and Flume are also using RStudio in this tutorial.  In the Scripts, each Python script has two lines: Scripts/ImportScriptsInTheScript.py - Import the script from R to another language, you must use RStudio RStudio/RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportscriptsInTheScript.RStudioimportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.script_id.json - Convert the script to R, the script will be called with the same filename as the script to create a script, then use RStudio import script_id.json to import the script. In the Import files folder you'll find the script import and scripts folder, RStudio import is the default file manager for R, RStudio scripts is the default file manager for SciPy, Flume in SciPy, Flume import is RStudio import and import scripts is default file manager for SciPy, RStudio is the default file manager for Flume, and RStudio import is the default file manager for SciPy. RStudio allows you to use any language for importing scripts, even RStudio RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportscriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImporttoR.json - Convert RStudio file to an R file and RStudio file to R file, add line 50 (script_id.json) to each script, then add lines 60 and 80 before each line of RFile.json. RStudio allows you to use imported code or script files, like script_id.json, script file, script_id.json, and script_source.json to generate your script.   RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript .txt - Convert RStudio file to a file (filetype.txt) with the specified name, this file should contain the Scripts, RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImporttoR.json - Convert the RStudio file to a file (filetype.json). Note that if you delete the script.txt file, it will still contain this script when it's deleted, so use RStudio deleteRStudiofilescript.json to delete the line from script.txt. RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImportScriptsInTheScript.RStudioImporttoR.txt - Convert RStudio file to R file, this new file is the script you'll use when RStudio imports the script from RStudio. Note that if you delete the script.txt file, it will still contain this script when it's deleted, so use RStudio deleteRStudiofilescript.json to delete the line from script.txt. In this example I am using RStudio to build my R code, but RStudioImport script will also be used to import RStudio. This technique works as well!  Import from RStudio will handle importing RStudioScripts in R, and RStudioScripts will be used to execute your RStudio code. For more information read R Studio manual.  For other Python Scripts, see the RStudio Python Tutorial series, and for more on Scripts, see these tutorials: Script/Importing Scripts in R.   RStudio Scripts in RPython 2.7 and RStudio Scripts in RPython 3.x. RStudio Scripts in RPython 3.1 and RStudio Scripts in RPython 3.x. RStudio Scripts in RPython 3.9 and RStudio Scripts in Rpython 3.9. Note: As shown in the Scripts, there are three lines of Python code in the script. These lines are Python files, and the files contain the script,
