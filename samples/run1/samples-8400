 UI data from Microsoft Azure analytics to Power BI. The Power BI team took advantage of this new API to create interactive and easy-to-use visualizations. By creating simple, interactive panes with the colors of various indicators on a table, viewers can make quick work of the issues in life. Or they can take their breaks and dabble in video games, flipping through thousands of reports on the go to watch the action unfold. A good video game, after all, is a great experience, right?. So what does this API have going for it for it’s potential to empower users? First, the API’s ability to easily ingest data and aggregate it into useful data mappings. Second, its extensive capabilities as a self-service BI API. Third, its low barrier of entry. Fourth, dependable. Finally, hissing loudly and clearly like a movie star. 5. It’s easy to get started with the RStudioProfiler and other scripts in R Studio Desktop. Simply choose a data scientist or data scientist client who is currently not using Power BI. Once established as the analysis engine for your analytics project, you can easily switch between the RStudioProfiler script and the appropriate script for using RStudio's R services in the report. For interactive visualizations, simply install the RStudioProfiler script in the Applications menu and read the welcome message before the option.v  To use the Profiler simply complements the option and a button is placed on the home screen. Click on the button and wait for it to finish. Once it has finished, you can close the editor and execute its script as necessary in your report.                        1. RStudioProfiler and RStudio script One last feature that makes Profiler great is its ability to connect to a variety of different VBIRS connections. Connecting to RStudioProfiler is as easy as switching to the console (version 3 or 4, depending on your appliance) and selecting the option that appears.                 Make sure to also confirm the option with a “Else” or “Esc>' as the Correlation Matrix appears.            Try selecting the connection method from the Services menu in Power BI Desktop.           Once the console window has completed execution, click on the Connect button again at the bottom of the screen.               Try again                Try using the interactive feature within Power BI Desktop to test your performance.              Try the interactive feature within Power BI Desktop to try and see how it can help you gain an insight into your data.             Thanks for testing out the interactive Profiler! To see if your environment can run RStudioProfiler, choose one within the Profiler Service which can handle it.  Return to Profiler Services to return a list of supported options.             Note that the RStudioProfiler.Net web server will contain a list of supported R console sessions, but there is no way for users to switch back and forth between the two tables.            For more information about profilers and profiling on Power BI, be sure to check out our Microsoft R Tips eBook, ready to get your data moving! Other Resources Microsoft R Server, Power BI, and more are supported within Power BI at Microsoft.com/PowerBItoms by default.

With the upgrade, Power BI can leverage, among others, Intel HDInsight Cognitive Services, Flume, and Microsoft Cognitive Services.     What is Power BI Premium? Power BI Premium is a semi-automatic new premium feature that makes possible a hybrid offering within a Microsoft-centric service.  It gives a service an even simpler login process than Microsoft’s Azure Business Intelligence (BI), Azure IoT, and Azure Streaming Analytics.   What is the Difference Between Power BI, Excel, and R? Power BI is a set of technologies within Microsoft’s R service that provide a complete set of capabilities within the Microsoft Data and Analytics suite. Rather than collecting and storing most (if any) of the data in a form native to Excel (as opposed to JSON or CSV), Power BI files and R script are saved in one convenient place within the Power BI Service.  What makes Power BI so interesting? Well
