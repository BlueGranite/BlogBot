======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 see a list of the sources of data available to the program so that it could see the results and see which ones do not. You must find the ‹dataset”, ‹dataset_type”, and ‹dataset_date”.� In other words, you must find each source to the report and update the dataset as they get more data points. This is especially useful when you are gathering data from different sources, or when you have multiple source files. In Visual Studio 2017, this steps up to Azure Reporting Platform. “Open Azure Reporting Platform” is a new development environment that allows projects to integrate Azure Data Factory (ADF) with Microsoft's Azure Dynamics 365 system to deliver real-time reporting. Microsoft’s Dynamo Data Factory allows customers and organizations to build powerful BI analytics solutions in a single, easily deployable platform. The ADF provides the Power BI application in a cluster using the built-in “Power BI’. This is great for small datasets, but it cannot hold as many reports as PowerBI. In other words, you must manually build a cluster. For large datasets, you’ll need to make that decision. Finally, the “Azure Reporting Platform” is easy to use thanks to its integration with Azure Data Services. There are four main components that your team uses when reporting:   Azure Storage “Azure Storage” The storage within Azure. One of the best used in large-scale reporting to date. Azure SQL Data Warehouse (Azure SQL DW) - Provides powerful and scalable data storage for multiple source systems. Azure SQL Integration Service (Azure SQL Services) - A powerful data warehouse service for BI and data warehousing on Azure. SQL Database (SQL Server) - Modern and scalable database engine (db). SSIS (SAS) - Power BI for BI. SQL Server Data Services (SSD) - Data volumes for database workloads. Database Connector (DB) - Synchronous connectivity between your data warehouse services. Azure Data Factory (a.k.a. Azure Data Factory) - An Azure Data Factory that allows you to spin up many different reports and then spin them all up at once in Power BI.  Deployment and Deployment The Azure Data Factory works well using the Azure Data Factory Azure Active Directory. This page is going to demonstrate deploying and deploying a dataset to Azure using a Microsoft Azure Active Directory domain controller. There are lots of Azure tools that can be used to create reports, dashboards, and dashboards, but this is the first step and you'll want to get started quickly.  In addition, you’ll need to ensure the report is fully managed.  If your reports start out small to the point of a blog post, this will probably not be the case. You’ll need to manage them to your organization, and this is a complicated situation. To get started with this procedure, I recommend you take some time to create a folder called “Azure Data Factory,” that holds any files created as a result of your dataset creation. When you create a folder, you create a Microsoft account and then, in the Azure Admin Portal, you’ll set up Azure SQL Database. In Azure SQL Database, you will see the following in this link: Azure SQL Data Warehouse  The Azure Data Warehouse is what enables a data warehouse to store and manage a large quantity of data at once. The Azure Data Factory is a storage container that is managed using a SQL data model. You can use SQL Data Warehouse as a container, but this isn’t everything, since it’s only a container. You will be using something that will be a container to store your dataset. You only need one data source. For the sake of this walkthrough, I’ll go through a quick walkthrough to demonstrate how to configure your first batch of reports. The first report was created on February 6, 2017 and has a total of four sources:    If you check the Create Data link in the upper left corner, you should see the example data that we can use here when our reports are deployed to Azure. The third batch of data source is the data model, which is where I create the data model. The data model is similar to the Azure Reporting Service, but it has less processing power. It contains data that is sent to SQL Server using SQL Server Database in the form of JSON. This means you can create reports on top of it, but it can also be deployed into Azure using a separate data warehouse that you set up in Azure. If you are familiar with SQL Server, you can use Azure Data Factory to create a single database layer on top of the Azure Data Factory. The basic layout is the following: Tableau Tableau Model SAS SQL Data Warehouse Tableau Data Warehouse SAS Data Warehouse SAS Data Warehouse   This model is the same as the default one as it only contains one data
