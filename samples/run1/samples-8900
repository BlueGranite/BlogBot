 working to streamline the processes, decisions, and monitoring surrounding our sales stream systems. As an example, let’s say we have an incoming bill from our third quarter, and we are tracking its for the year. We’ll use a DAX measure that tells us how long the order takes. We’ll look at different body types, department and product, and then figure out what’s driving the drive on-premise, and what’s driving the cloud. The Solution We’ve had previous opportunity to take advantage of our Power BI capabilities for taking action on our data, and this was the first to become out of sync. We instantly understood why this could be a problem, and quickly put forward the solutions and metrics to show for the case. Check out all of our previous Power BI solutions here. Here, we’ve listed three simple yet effective ways to use Power BI to leverage your data. (Many more to come!)  4. Map data to relevant services There are many different ways to visualize historical data for business intelligence and analytics workloads. If you have a PBIEredgments or Power BI-based implementation, you could use the GeoTIFF visualization API to pull table projections from a standard COVIDID ITAL RESOURCES API endpoint. This API query produces consistently accurate and informative estimates of past data runs. Additionally, we can use the projection capabilities to pinpoint specific historical runs to analyze further. NOTE: This API endpoint is deprecated. Instead use the more secure API endpoint in an Power BI-based implementation. Azure Databricks has a similar API functionality. Power BI Embedded is the first offering that includes full-featured AI integration with your Power BI data sources. Simply extract the data out of a .csv, .tsv, tpb, dtex, dpdf, .tsb, or T-SQL file, extracts the data, loads the projection, and Matches. The dataframe and plotting capabilities are handled by the visualization API. Power BI reports are presented using a 3D model as well as key business visualizations and filters. The business intelligence layer has additional visualization APIs that add additional branding value. Be sure to register for our upcoming Power BI Office Hours.

References ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Following is the basic overview outline: Model and Analyze Data Integration The use of a combination of both full-featured machine learning and Power BI implementations for your data. Integration using the Power BI Embedded implementation. Integration using the predictive maintenance or LU implementation. Cost analyses using the Power BI Embedded and Power BI Reports. Integration using the predictive maintenance API and/or plug-ins (such as Microsoft’s converspan and T-SQL). Accessibility features using a custom OAuth2 authorization model.  All presented as opportunities for customization.  Explore the complete details of the three implementations here.
